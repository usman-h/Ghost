# Ghost
Ghost is an AI project aimed at the testing community.
Ghost's main objectives are to help reduce test failure analysis and will later on evolve to autofix simple maintenance errors.

Currently any network issues resulting in test failures are flagged within the cucumber generated reports using logs from Har files.
These are analysed and the key error statements are logged along side the test failure.
Other than network issues, any test code issues are also highlighted. These are achieved by comparing what element is being looked for by comparing it to the page's DOM at the time of failure.

This project works best when used in conjunction with '**Habanero**'
For more information on the testing framework **Habanero**, please go to https://github.com/usman-h/Habanero 

Ghost is a project that will help save time to projects/programmes and test teams so that anyone who is testing can spend their time more productively.
